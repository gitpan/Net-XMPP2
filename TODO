  see also http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#scoping-defaulting )

- put some serious stuff in the synopsises

- implement iq-auth!!!!

- fix problem that xml::writer writes after <stream/> ahs been written
  - reproduce by conflicting resources!

- Net::XMPP2 missing functionality to be RFC 3920 conform:
   - improve error handling for SASL to

      the changed credentials)
   - SRV record lookup

- keep an eye on:
   - TLS: implemented, just do some extensive testing WRT blocking,
          i don't trust the current way the watchers are handled,
          i'm in fear of deadlocks...

- Implement XEP-0030: Service Discovery
   - see also: XEP-0128: Service Discovery Extensions
